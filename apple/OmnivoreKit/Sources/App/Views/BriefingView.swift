## Highlights

- [ ] Big brands keep dropping X over antisemitism; $75M loss, report estimates | Ars Technica
  - [ ] Musk [responded](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1728164110137725260) to an X user who [said](https://x.com/JohnnaCrider1/status/1728155588993970484?s=20) that some users were "mad" over lower ad revenue-sharing, saying there was "not much we can do if advertisers boycott or reduce spend on our platform."
- [ ] 'Project DNA': How Japan's J1 League became a 'flair factory' for Europe's top clubs
  - [ ] communities are being bound to clubs to create a nascent cultural heritage.
  - [ ] The FA and the J1 League brought prefectures, associations, clubs, coaches, universities and schools together to work for a common good. There is a Japanese concept ‚Äì ‚Äúikigai‚Äù ‚Äì which describes the sourcing of meaning or fulfilment from a purpose. The national team was the ikigai.
  - [ ] That aim is governed by regulation. It is now mandatory for every club to run their own academy with at least Under-15 and Under-18 teams. There are limits on the number of foreigners on each squad. The first team starting XI must contain at least two homegrown players and one Under-21 player.
  - [ ] Clubs are also rewarded for developing and playing academy graduates. The earlier the player moves, the more development they get in a different footballing culture and the more space it allows for another young player to replace them.
  - [ ] But in 2016, the Japanese FA created ‚ÄúProject DNA‚Äù, an initiative that aimed to adjust and amend existing training methods to produce more rounded footballers. They sent coaches to European clubs, including those in the Premier League. They studied and they cherry-picked and they vowed that insularity should never rule because Japan would never have enough alone.
  - [ ] Japan‚Äôs most successful recent exports (Mitoma at Brighton, Daichi Kamada at Eintracht Frankfurt, Takefusa Kubo at Real Sociedad) are fun, unpredictable, exciting attacking players.
